# WaveBased

<!-- It is known that compactly supporte orthonormal wavelet bases do not have analytical expression
(Haar is the only exception). However, it is often necessary to calculate these values at arbitrary
points. In nonparametric statistics this is useful to estimate functions such as densities and
non-equally spaced regression. functions Daubechies and Lagarias (1992) proposed an algorithm useful
to provide, with pre -->

This is an R package that can be useful to solve different nonparametric problems via wavelet bases.
The main functions are capable to provide several compactly supported orthonormal wavelet bases by
the Daubechies-Lagarias algorithm (Daubechies and Lagarias, 1992).

As soon as possible, other functions aiming to solve statistical problems will be included.
